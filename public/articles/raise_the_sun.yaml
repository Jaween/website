  Raise the Sun is a short single-player experience created over a weekend as part of the Global Game Jam 2016. The theme was ‘Ritual’.

  The player must explore in the dark with a candle to perform the ritual of alighting sconces around an ancient structure.

  The team over scoped the game during the initial design phase and consequently had to cut features during the 48 hour development period. The resulting game has a nice atmosphere, but it is very short.

  I worked on various bits and pieces throughout the game, including most of the in-game cutscenes and general logic around the lighting of the wall sconces.
