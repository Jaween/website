  Rhythm Heaven VR is a remake of the Night Walk minigame from the Nintendo Wii game [Rhythm Heaven Fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_Heaven_Fever). This game was made in a week in order to learn about virtual reality development and also as a fun experiment with VR input. The game is controlled by nodding to the beat of the music. 

  The original Wii game used a two-button input method, but this version uses a buttonless gaze-based interaction, leading to some interesting development challenges.

  The Wii game has the player press the A-button on each beat, and occasionally there is an offbeat sequence where the player has to briefly hold the A-button and B-buttons. My remake maps the A-button to a slight nod from the user. The offbeat action is mapped to a look downwards followed by a look upwards. 

  Requiring a vigorous a nod was uncomfortable, so there is very generous nod-detection. The in-game character had to have its walk speed and distance from the player tweaked, such that it didn't cause dizziness.
