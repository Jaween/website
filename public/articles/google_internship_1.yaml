  My first internship was at Google's main campus in California, and my project was to port the SDL2 library to Googleâ€™s Mojo IPC system.
  
  [SDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_DirectMedia_Layer) is an open source library which provides a layer of abstraction for developers to access multimedia hardware (displays, input devices, audio devices, etc). It's often used to create crossplatform video games. 
  
  [Mojo](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/mojo/README.md) is the system for inter-process communication (IPC) developed for Chromimum. The development team I was working in was developing the Fuchsia operating system, of which Mojo is a major component. The goal of my project was to see how well graphics intensive applications performed on top of Mojo.

  The project took place over my three month internship. After onboarding, the first few weeks were focused on understanding Mojo by reading the documentation and writing a simple Mojo application. The next seven or so weeks were spent getting the video, input and threading subsystems of SDL up and running.

  After those subsystems were working we wanted to run a game on Mojo. We wound up choosing [RB Doom 3 BFG](https://github.com/RobertBeckebans/RBDOOM-3-BFG). To get the game running we had to hack in implementations for a few missing OpenGL methods in our OpenGL implementation [ANGLE](https://github.com/google/angle) (another piece of software that came out of Chromium). I worked with ANGLE for the final two weeks of my project with my intern host and another graphics engineer on the team.

  The result was Doom 3 running on Mojo via my SDL 2 port!
