  Quack 'n Splat was a computer game I made in 2005. It was probably my first complete piece of software.

  It was made in Game Maker 6 using drag and drop blocks of logic rather than typing out code. I drew the assets in Microsoft Paint animated them in Game Maker’s sprite editor.

  The game's description, as written by 10 year old me, was:

  >Shoot as many of the angry birds as you can within the time limit. Don't shoot the nice birds.
  I sold a copy to my friend for $1, and his feedback was “Quack 'n Splat rocks!”.

  In 2008, I remade the game with my improved programming and drawing abilities. This time the game was called Quack 'n Splat Deluxe and was fully written in Game Maker's inbuilt programming language, GML.

  I continued working on the game, and released an updated version in 2009, this time called simply Quack 'n Splat.
