  This game was developed in Unity over 48 hours as part of the 2017 Global Game Jam. The theme for this jam was 'Waves'.

  In our game, the player navigates a submarine through a pitch black tunnel using a pulsing sonar.

  My main contribution was the implementation of the sonar effect. It is achieved by representing the sonar wavefront as a plane which travels down the tunnel. Each fragment of the tunnel geometry is shaded based on their distance to that plane. So the closer the fragment is to the wavefront, the brighter it is.

  This logic was inserted into the standard Unity shader, so that the shader could continue to take advantage of the existing lighting functionality. There are faint square-shaped artifacts around light sources in the tunnel, but I didn't know enough about Unity's shader pipeline to solve this. I think the artifacts are due the shaders performing multiple passes around each light source.

  The game was developed by:
