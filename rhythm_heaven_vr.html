      Rhythm Heaven VR is a remake of the Night Walk minigame from the Nintendo Wii game Rhythm Heaven Fever. The project was done with the purpose of learning how to develop for Virtual Reality and also as a general experiment in VR input. The game is controlled by nodding to the beat of the music. Rhythm Heaven VR was developed over the course of a week, so please forgive any bugs you might encounter.
      <br/><br/>
      Moving from a two-button input method used in the original title to a buttonless gaze based input method required key changes to the interaction. In the original title, the player presses the A button on each beat to make the character hop. In addition to this there is a special offbeat that requires holding both the A and B buttons simultaneously and releasing them after a short pause, launching the character into the air. Having the user nod on each beat is a straight forward decision. The
      The approach taken was to have the user tilt their head downwards
      <br/><br/>
      Some lessons learned:
      <ul>
        <li>Very slight nods must be detected</li>
        <li>Nodding too vigorously can cause dizziness</li>
        <li>The character must walk in a circle around the player at a speed that doesnâ€™t cause dizziness</li>
      </ul>
