2016 February
<br/><br/>
Rhythm Heaven VR is a remake of the Night Walk minigame from the Nintendo Wii game Rhythm Heaven Fever. The game was created in order to learn about Virtual Reality development and also as a fun VR input experiment. The game is controlled by nodding to the beat of the music. Rhythm Heaven VR was developed rapidly over the course of a week, so there are many bugs.
<br/><br/>
The original title used a two-button input method, whereas this version uses a buttonless gaze based interaction, leading to some interesting development challenges. In the original title, there are two types of player interactions. The first is pressing the A-button on each beat to make the character skip in time with the music. The second is a special offbeat that requires holding both the A-button and B-button simultaneously, then releasing them after a short pause, launching the character into the air. The A-button was mapped to a slight nod from the user. The A+B Button offbeat interaction was mapped to a deep nod down and then a steep nod up. 
<br/><br/>
Detecting nods had to be very generous. Requiring a vigorous a nod would be uncomfortable. The in-game character also had to walk at a speed that didn&#39;t cause dizziness to the player.
