2005, 2008 and 2009
<br/><br/>
Quack ‘n Splat was my first complete piece of software. Made in Game Maker 6 using drag and drop blocks of logic. All of the art was drawn myself in Microsoft Paint and Game Maker’s inbuilt graphics editor. The game’s description as written by 10 year old me in the help page is “Shoot as many of the angry birds as you can within the time limit. Don't shoot the nice birds”. I sold a copy for a dollar to my friend and his feedback was “Quack ‘n Splat rocks!”. 

<br/><br/>
In 2008 I decided to remake the original game leveraging more coding experience and an improved ability to draw pixel art. This game was called ‘Quack ‘n Splat Deluxe’ and was fully written in GML.
<br/><br/>
The game was remade again in 2009, this time called simply ‘Quack ‘n Splat’. Again the game’s art and code quality was improved.
