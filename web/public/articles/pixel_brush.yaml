  Pixel Brush is an app for drawing pixel art.

  Development started in 2014 and lasted until it was published in alpha to the Google Play store. Development picked up again in early 2017 was released as an open beta soon after. As of May 2019, the app has received 86,000 downloads on Google Play.

  In primary school I wanted to create a combination between Microsoft Paint and the sprite editor from Game Maker 5.3A.

  In late 2018 I began reworking the app to add sprite animations, layers and iOS support.
