  I made this game by myself in Global Game Jam 2019. The theme of this jam was 'What home means to you'.

  The idea is that for lots of people 'home' means the agony of air travel. To this end, an airline has introduced catapults to make the flight home less troublesome. From a little tropical island, the player controls a catapult and launches passengers back to their home country.

  As I had no artists this year, I used free assets from the Unity Asset Store and [Freesound](https://freesound.org).
