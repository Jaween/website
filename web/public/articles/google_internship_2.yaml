  My second internship was at Google's YouTube campus in California.

  The YouTube Community feature was introduced to help creators engage with fans using methods other than video. It gives creators a social wall to write posts, conduct polls and write comments, so that they can interact more closely with their subscribers. This is all done from within the YouTube platform so that creators won't have to recreate their subscriber-base on other social media.

  My intern project was to provide creators the ability to add special effects to their Community image posts from the YouTube Android app. 

  It involved integrating an internal Google image recognition library into the YouTube app, designing a frontend user interface and implementing the feature.

  The feature was implemented into the YouTube Android app as a non-public experiment. At present, YouTube Community is in closed beta, and invitations appear to go out to creators with over 1000 subscribers. I haven't verified yet if the special effects feature was ever enabled publically.
