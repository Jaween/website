  Developed in Unity over 48 hours as part of the 2018 Global Game Jam. 'Transmission' was the theme of the jam. You. Are. Transmission. is a First Person Action game in which the main mechanic is the ability to teleport, serving as a means of locomotion as well as the method to destroy enemies (by teleporting through them).

  The game's AI system was developed by myself, using Unity's Navigation Mesh features to perform path finding, as well as a set of simple movement tactics (advance, flee, strafe and flee while strafing).

  The game was developed by team 'Shak Attack':
