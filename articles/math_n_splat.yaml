  Math 'n Splat was a project I made in year 10 to create an educational game for kids in junior primary school. I  wanted the game mechanics to teach a skill, but I couldnâ€™t come up with anything fun. So I ended up splitting the mechanics into two parts, a fun part and a educational part.

  The player shoots the flying saucers in a space invaders type setup, and occasionally is made to answer an arithmetic problem.
  
  It was probably more educational and enjoyable for me to make this game than for the kids to play it. It was developed in Visual Basic.
